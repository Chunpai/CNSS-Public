# Calibrated Nonparametric Scan Statistics

## Install and Run:  
1. install anaconda
2. download and unzip the code
3. run following commands
```
cd CNSS
conda env create   
source init_env.sh
cd exps
python exp_cnss_alter.py
```

## Note:  
* Due to large size of datasets, we only put the wikivote dataset here. But other datasets are 
  assessible via SNAP website: [https://snap.stanford.edu/data/](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/).
* When run `python exp_cnss_alter.py`, it only runs a single case of alternative hypothesis. 
  However, we ran 50 cases and reported the average performance in the paper. 
  We also include all 50 cases for various signal strengths in the data folder.
* For each run, it takes roughly about 30 minutes.
* We had pre-computed the alpha-prime using randomization tests and lower bounds for wikivote 
  dataset, which is generated by running `python exp_cnss_null.py`. 
  Randomization tests are not computational efficient, and we recommend to only run the 
  neighbor_analysis if you don't have computer cluster to run randomization tests in 
  parallel. Alpha prime based on percolation theory could be computed in real time, so there is 
  no preprocessing step for it. 
* We do not include the code of core tree decomposition here, because we are not allowed to 
  share it without author's consent.
